# VRPong

At the time of this writing, this is my most recent project. I've really enjoyed creating this project and am still sinking a lot of time and effort. This is my first true professional experience within game development, and has given me much opportunity to develop my skills as a programmer and designer. This project is my first ever that is made for VR.

The concept behind the game was inspired by 8-bit pong, and the motivation to bring that gameplay to a 3D space. There are many features still planned, but currently the gameplay functions as a sort of target practice... try to hit and direct the ball to destroy targets for score. As the sole developer, I've had many challenges to overcome and many techniques and skills to learn. The two favourite systems to develop were the target spawning system (in the ATargetManager and ATarget classes) and the retool database webhook and API - Which has been removed from this upload for security purposes, but I am happy to discuss.

Features planned include:

- Multiplayer
- Powerups
- Different game modes
- Booth movement
- Free roam
